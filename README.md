Explorations of the **Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)** in Julia.  
This repository is not a package - it is a collection of small tests, explorations, self-contained experiments, each in its own folder.

- Each subfolder (`01_minimal/`, `02_variant/`, etc) contains a single implementation attempt.
- The goal is to keep experiments **short** and easy to read.
- The shared environment (`Project.toml`) in the repo root specifies dependencies.

## Usage

From the repo root, start Julia and activate the environment:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
